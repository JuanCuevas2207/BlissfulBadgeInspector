# BlissfulBadgeInspector
BlissfulBadgeInspector is an application that validates the loading of avatars before they are uploaded. Developed by Juan Cuevas!

This project validates the loading of an avatar that must have the following features:
1. The format must be in png
2. The avatar must be inside a circle.
3. The image must have size 512x512 pixels.
4. The pixels inside the circle must not be transparent.
5. The colors of the avatar should give a feeling of happiness :)

It also has functions to test in real time if the avatar is valid, to generate a random avatar in case you don't have one and even to change the current format.
